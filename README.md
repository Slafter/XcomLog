# XcomLog

***Currently on hold due to the release of Long War 2. I'm seeking a method to decode XCOM2 save files into something readable so that I can adapt this project into use with Long War 2.***

Unlike other Firaxis games, XCOM lacks any kind of replay feature to view the history of a playthrough. XcomLog seeks to log all actions made in a campaign and organize them in a easily readable fashion allowing the user to share their campaigns with others or improve their strategy based off of past actions.
